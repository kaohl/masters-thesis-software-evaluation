How reliable is this report?
This could be used to argue for using a specific set of JDKs/JREs.

Most popular version in production: Java 14
Most popular vendor: Amazon

JDKs = [ Amazon, Oracle, Eclipse Adoptium, Red Hat ]
VERs = [8, 11, 14, 17]

# Heap size
- 64MB,128,256,512,1G,2,4,8,16,32
* Probably takes to long time to run with all these size configs

# Garbage Collector
- Most popular: Garbage-First (G1)
- What are our options? (Does it depend on vendor?)

# Container
- We could run benchmarks in a container as well just to see
  how much performance differs but this has nothing to do with
  refactoring... or at least I don't see a connection at the
  moment.
