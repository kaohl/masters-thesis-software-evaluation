An experiment applies refactoring opportunities given by a set of
refactoring descriptor lists and benchmarks the resulting code.
Each line on such a list is a JSON object representing a refactoring
descriptor originating from the opportunity cache from an eclipse
workspace. Before being written onto an opportunity list, default
and custom parameters are applied to complete the descriptor.

Descriptor lists should be saved together with benchmark configuration
and results for the sake of reproducibility. They are therefore located
inside experiment workload folders:

    <experiment-location>/<name>/workloads/<bm>/<workload>/lists/<list ...>/...

Here we describe the layout and formatting of the resources related
to the construction of these descriptor lists.

A list (of refactoring descriptors) is the union of result sets
produced by a collection of filtered queries on the eclipse
workspace opportunity cache.

List resources are organized on disk as follows:

lists/
   default.args
   list-0/
       q0.filter, q0.params, q0.defaults
       q1.filter, q1.params, q1.defaults
       ...
       qn.filter, qn.params, qn.defaults
   list-1/
       q0.filter, q0.params, q0.defaults
       q1.filter, q1.params, q1.defaults
       ...
       qm.filter, qm.params, qm.defaults
   ...
   list-k/
       q0.filter, q0.params, q0.defaults
       q1.filter, q1.params, q1.defaults
       ...
       ql.filter, ql.params, ql.defaults

The 'q_x.filter' file is a JSON object representing
a 'meta' attribute filter that is applied to the
opportunity cache to produce a list of descriptors.

See implementation for supported object format.

The 'q_x.params' file holds one JSON object per line.
Each line hold a JSON formatted parameter object.
Each parameter object is applied to each descriptor
that matches the associated 'q_x.filter'. I.e.,
descriptors are multiplied to cover all possible
parameter configurations.

The 'default.args' file is a text file holding a JSON object
defining default arguments for each refactoring descriptor
type that is currently in use. (Update when found incomplete.)

The 'q_x.defaults' files are optional.

The purpose of 'q_x.defaults' is to override 'default.args'
for the 'q_x' query. It is therefore possible to vary all
descriptor parameters in experiments.


# Custom lists
If the user wants to use a custom assembled descriptor list
it can be placed in a file called 'descriptors.txt' placed
in a workload list folder. It is then simply a pre-computed
list from the perspective of the framework.
